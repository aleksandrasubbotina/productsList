# productsList
A script that helps me write bodies for API requests.

I manually test a web app (groceries delivery) for my study project. I have to make various requests that contain product IDs and quantity. This script helps me create body examples in JSON format, so I don't need to write lots of text over and over.

First I wrote it using Python, then added a bash script that
is convenient to use in command line.
